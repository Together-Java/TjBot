# Together Java Moderation Bot

## About
The intention of this bot is to make moderation easier and provide useful commands to manage the server.

## Running the bot
1. Copy `src/main/resources/sample-config.yml` and use it to structure your bot config.
    We recommend to copy the file to ./local-config.yml since this is added to the .gitignore file so that your token is not pushed to the repository. 
2. Start the bot with following arguments: `-c path/to/your/config`
